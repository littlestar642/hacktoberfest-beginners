# Getting started with competitive coding

Competitive coding is a very vast topic which needs to mastered specifically for tackling interviews. 
However people get confused about how they should get started with it and maintain a healthy balance between coding and academics.
Here's a few ways I would suggest which would help you to get started and continue with the sport of competitive coding.
If you are totally new to online coding then you can go to <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/practice-onboarding/welcome-to-online-programming-1/">New to coding!</a> to get know about basic input output functions and things like that.<br>
Next up you can do a 30 days of Code on Hackerrank which will introduce you to basic algorithmic questions.<br>

You can also refer to <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/codemonk/">Code monk</a> to get questions from different topics according to your level.
Finally all the sites <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com">HackerEarth</a>, <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">Hackerrank</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/">Codechef</a> and <a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> holds competitions regularly which you can take part in to increase your speed and accuracy.
ICPC(hosted on codechef) is known as the olympics of coding and it has participation from all round the globe. <a href="https://www.spoj.com/">Spoj</a> is a good site for ICPC level questions.<br>
Competitive coding is all about practice. You need not have any prerequisite knowledge or intelligence to get started with it.Once you get started, you will fall in love with it in no time at all.
